# Sample Weather Service

The aim of the service is mostly practice but beyond that to get current geolocation-based weather information and store it into a database and also to provide these stored data to 3rd party applications.

And the main goal is - of course - to create a production-ready example application which can be easily deployed to AWS at the end.
